# Fruit Detection Project

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the classification of plant images into different categories. It includes code for training the model, making predictions on new images, and evaluating the model's performance.

## Overview

The project consists of the following components:

1. **Training Script**: `train_model.py` - This script trains a CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras on a dataset of plant images. The trained model is saved for future use.

2. **Prediction Script**: `predict_plant.py` - This script loads the trained model and makes predictions on new images. It takes an input image and outputs the predicted plant class along with the confidence score.

3. **Pre-Trained Model**: `plant_detection_model_2.h5` - This file contains a pre-trained CNN model for plant classification. It can be used directly for making predictions without training.

4. **Data**: The project includes a dataset of plant images (`split_ttv_dataset_type_of_plants`) divided into training, testing, and validation sets.
